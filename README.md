## Repository Description

This repository contains the Vivado projects and hardware designs for all of the demos that we provide for the Genesys2. As some demos also require software sources contained in Vitis workspaces, this repository should not be used directly. The [Genesys2](https://github.com/Digilent/Genesys2) repository contains all sources for these demos across all tools, and pulls in all of this repository's sources by using it as a submodule.

For instructions on how to use this repository with git, and for additional documentation on the submodule and branch structures used, please visit [Digilent FPGA Demo Git Repositories](https://reference.digilentinc.com/reference/programmable-logic/documents/git) on the Digilent Wiki. Note that use of git is not required to use this demo. Digilent recommends the use of project releases, for which instructions can be found in each demo wiki page, linked in the table of demos, above.

Some demos were moved into this repository during 2020.1 updates. History of these demos prior to these updates can be found in their old repositories, linked below:
